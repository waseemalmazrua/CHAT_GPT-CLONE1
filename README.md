# WaseemGPT

This is a simple interactive chatbot project inspired by ChatGPT, created as part of my hands-on learning journey in Data Science and AI.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to connect a frontend interface with OpenAIâ€™s GPT models using JavaScript and basic web technologies.

## Features

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based UI
- Connects to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo via API
- Styled to resemble ChatGPT
- Interactive input and response display
- Docker-ready project structure (for future deployment)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo)
- Docker (for containerization)

## Important Note

The API key is not included in this repository for security reasons.  
Currently, the key is stored in the frontend for testing purposes only.  
The public version of the project is not deployed online to avoid exposing the key.

In future versions, a proper backend (Node.js/Express) will be implemented to securely handle requests and hide sensitive keys.

## What I Learned

- How to build an AI-enabled UI
- Handling API authentication and security
- Using Docker to containerize frontend projects
- Practical integration of LLMs into real applications

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.
